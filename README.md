## Requirement
1.- I have a project built with Elementor and we have multiple post authors who just need to add citations to the articles that already exist.
2.- There is a project whose posts have multiple bad links within the post_content, so it is necessary to check and list which links generate problems and in which post they were detected.


## --Author Quotes-- 
  ## Shortcode -> [mc-citacion] / [mc-citacion post_quote_id = "POST_ID"]

## --BadLinks Scanner-- 
  ## Menu Element => BadLinks Scanner
  ## (php-curl extention required)


Included wordpress-dev-challenge.zip for installation.

Plugin developed and tested in WP6.
